  <h2>Black Comedy</h2>
  <p>Some of my favorite <strong><u>Black comedy series</u></strong> includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman">Bojack Horseman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy">Family Guy</a>, which are all animated series.</p>

  <p>BoJack Horseman is an American adult animated black comedy-drama series created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg. The series stars Will Arnett as the title character, with a supporting cast including Amy Sedaris, Alison Brie, Paul F. Tompkins, and Aaron Paul. The series' first season premiered on August 22, 2014, on Netflix, with a Christmas special premiering on December 19. The show is designed by the cartoonist Lisa Hanawalt, who had previously worked with Bob-Waksberg on the webcomic Tip Me Over, Pour Me Out.</p>
  <img src="Family Guy.jpg" width="600">
  <p>Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.</p>
